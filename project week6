## Summary
**NASAÂ APODÂ Viewer** is an Android app that fetches NASAâ€™s *Astronomyâ€¯Pictureâ€¯ofâ€¯theâ€¯Day* endpoint and shows a **scrollable gallery** of the dayâ€™s images, each with its title and short description.

If I had to describe this project in threeâ€¯emojis, they would be: **ðŸš€â€¯ðŸŒŒâ€¯ðŸ“·**

## Notes
- Learned how to expose a **BuildConfig** field fromâ€¯`local.properties` so API keys stay out of VCS.  
- Debugged Retrofit 403 errors by inspecting `response.errorBody()` and verifying key quotas.  
- Practiced migrating from view binding to **dataâ€¯binding** for cleaner adapter code.
wasnt able to complete as my PC files are corrupted.
